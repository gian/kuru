The kupeg bootstrap.sml was created using Kragen Javier Sitaker's very cool Javascript-based
PEG generator, found here:

http://github.com/kragen/peg-bootstrap

The kupeg.peg is the file I used as input to his "output.js" to generate SML.
The resultant SML code was not actually valid SML - it took a considerable amount of
hand-tweaking to make something that was both valid Javascript and valid SML.

The process went something like this:

Apply output.js to kupeg.peg --> kupeg.js
Apply kupeg.js to kupeg.peg --> kupeg.sml
Apply kupeg.sml to kupeg.kpg --> bootstrap.sml

The bootstrap.sml file is the one found in src/kupeg. 

Thanks a bunch to Kragen for implementing his PEG compiler-compiler in the first instance,
and for his help in getting it running for my purposes!
